cv: I have been a full professor of Numerical Analysis at the department of mathematics at the University of Trento since 2020. I received a PhD in Mathematics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 1993 where I worked at the department of applied mathematics as an assistant professor  until 1996. In 2000 I joined the department of mathematics of Università degli Studi di Milano as a researcher and then I moved to the University of Trento where I have worked since 2003. 
research_interests: My research activity is in the numerical approximation of partial differential equations and computational electromagnetism, using in particular finite element methods. I am also interested in inverse problems and in domain decomposition methods. I have worked on the eddy current approximation of Maxwell equations, and recently I’ve been working on the numerical approximation of the eigenvalue problem of the curl operator, and on high order polynomial differential forms.

cv: "I have received the Master’s degree in Mathematics at the University La Sapienza of Rome in 1978 and the Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1986. I have been first Researcher, then Associate professor, then (since 2005) Full Professor of Mathematical Analysis at the University of Trento. I spent periods of study at Cornell University, as Fulbright Fellow at Princeton University and as a visiting professor at Arizona State University."
research_interests: "My research activity has been almost entirely devoted to mathematical models in biology, and in particular on ecology and epidemiology. In my research I have dealt, on one hand, with the design and selection of detailed models adequate for the analysis of empirical data and, on the other hand, with the qualitative analysis of theoretical models aiming at understanding general patterns and trends. Among my recent research interests are
the dynamics of vector-borne infections, in particular those transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, considering their ecological interactions;
the analysis of immuno-epidemiological models, i.e. where between-host transmission dynamics is coupled to intra-host immunological interactions;
the use of methods from singular perturbation theory in the analysis of epidemic models."

  cv: Mario Lauria earned a Laurea Magistrale in Electrical Engineering and a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the "Federico II" University of Naples, and a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He worked as a post-doc in computer science at the University of Illinois at U-C and at the University of California, San Diego, and from 2000 to 2007 as an Assistant Professor in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. After moving back to Italy he spent four years in the Systems Biology group at the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM) in Naples, and in May 2011 he joined the Microsoft Research-University of Trento Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI) in Rovereto, Italy. In December 2016 he joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Trento as associate professor of computational biology. Mario Lauria is a former Fulbright scholar, a recipient of a NATO Science Fellowship, and a Senior Member of the IEEE.
  research_interests: "Mario’s research interests are in the area of the analysis of biological data in a broad sense. The types of data of interest include molecular profiles (expression profiles, miRNA profiles, etc.), sensor data (for example, accelerometers, ECG, etc.), data collected using smartphones for clinical applications.  Some recent projects are:
  development of novel methods for the identification of diagnostic biomarkers based on -omics profiles; 
  investigation of systems biology approaches to perform integrative data analysis; 
  development of methods for the inference of gene regulation networks and their analysis; 
  investigation of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases using gene expression profiles
  analysis of patient movement data collected using smartphone apps and activity trackers."
