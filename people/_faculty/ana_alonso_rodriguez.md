cv: I have been a full professor of Numerical Analysis at the department of mathematics at the University of Trento since 2020. I received a PhD in Mathematics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 1993 where I worked at the department of applied mathematics as an assistant professor  until 1996. In 2000 I joined the department of mathematics of Università degli Studi di Milano as a researcher and then I moved to the University of Trento where I have worked since 2003. 
research_interests: My research activity is in the numerical approximation of partial differential equations and computational electromagnetism, using in particular finite element methods. I am also interested in inverse problems and in domain decomposition methods. I have worked on the eddy current approximation of Maxwell equations, and recently I’ve been working on the numerical approximation of the eigenvalue problem of the curl operator, and on high order polynomial differential forms.
