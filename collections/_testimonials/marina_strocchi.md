1. **What's your name and where are you from?**
   Marina Strocchi, I am from Lugo, Emilia-Romagna in Italy.

2. **What did you study before the master?**
   Before the master, I studied Mathematics at the University of Bologna.

3. **Why did you choose this master?**
   The University of Trento was one of the few universities in Italy offering a variety of masters in Applied Mathematics, which was what I was interested in at the time.

4. **What do you consider to be the strong points of the master?**
   The strongest point of the masters is the variety of Applied Maths programs it  offers, and the flexibility to mix courses from different programmes as well. This allowed me to study what I was interested in the most without being constrained by the pre-defined courses I had.   

5. **What did you like about the masters?**
    I liked the programme as a whole, because it spanned across different fields of Applied Maths (epidemiology, cell biology, blood flow). This allows the students to explore different fields and understand what they like the most.
   
7. **What did you do immediately after the master?**
    I taught Maths in high school for a few months, came back to the University of Trento for a couple of months for a research project with professor Eleuterio Toro, and I finally started a PhD at King’s College London in the UK.

8.  **What are you doing right now in terms of work?**
    I am a Research Fellow at Imperial College London, UK, working in Professor Steve Niederer’s research group.
    
9.  **Would you recommend the Masters to someone? To whom in particular?**
    I would definitely recommend this masters, especially to maths students who are interested in Applied Maths. The biology/biomedical programme is amazing (this is what I studied), but there are other available fields too. The environment provided by the university is quite international and the courses are in English, which is very helpful in general but especially if one wants to find a job abroad afterwards.
