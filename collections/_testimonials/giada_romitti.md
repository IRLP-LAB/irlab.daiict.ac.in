1. **What's your name and where are you from?**

   My name is Giada Sira Romitti, and I am from Verona (Italy).

2. **What did you study before the master?**
   
   I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at the University of Trento, and before that I graduated from high school in a “Liceo Scientifico” in my hometown.

3. **Why did you choose this master?**

   During my Bachelor's degree course, after the first two years of courses, I realized that the branch of Mathematics that fascinates me the most is Numerical Analysis. In the third year, during my Erasmus experience, I had the opportunity to participate to several multidisciplinary seminars. Scientists from a wide variety of fields took turns addressing the most current topics involving Mathematics, Biology and Medicine, which showed that teamwork is an indispensable skill. I did not mind deepening, for mere personal pleasure, these subjects and search for mathematical correlations in contemporary literature. When I graduated from the Bachelor’s degree, I knew that a research group on these topics had been set up at the University of Trento few years earlier, so I decided to apply for a position at this Master course. I was enthusiastic about learning how different field of sciences could relate to each other. Moreover, I wanted to work in an open field, in which I could participate actively to the research and that, even though indirectly, could involve human health.

4. **What do you consider to be the strong points of the master?**

   In my opinion, the strong point of this master's degree is its ability to provide multidisciplinary learning. There is a wide range of courses to choose from, ranging from the mathematical to the biological field. In the various courses you may see similar themes, but they are always analyzed from a different point of view, thus giving a comprehensive view of the subject and allowing you to develop critical thinking on different topics.

5. **What did you like about the masters?**

   There are many aspects I liked about the master's degree. At the learning level, most of the courses offer theoretical and practical knowledge, and propose realistic projects to be solved with the techniques taught. At the course level, the wide range of courses offered in different fields and with different focuses on mathematics applied to bio-medicine. At the content level, the right balance between theoretical mathematical aspects and application of concepts and the analysis of current biomedical problems with the possibility of doing research projects.
   
6. **What did you do immediately after the master?**

   In the period just before the end of my Master's degree, when I was preparing my final thesis, I realized that I would like to continue my research in this field. I therefore started sending PhD applications to Italian and foreign universities. Having been accepted, I started my PhD immediately after my Master's degree.

7.  **What are you doing right now in terms of work?**

   I am currently continuing my PhD at the University of València (Spain), which I started a year and a half ago. My PhD focuses on topics in atrial electrophysiology, with the goal of creating digital twins for personalized therapy of atrial fibrillation.
    
8.  **Would you recommend the Masters to someone? To whom in particular?**

   I highly recommend this master’s degree, especially to all students who want to increase their transversal skills by applying mathematical knowledge to current biomedical topics.
