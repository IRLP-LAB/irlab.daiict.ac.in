1. **What's your name and where are you from?**

   My name is Eleonora and I am from Florence.

2. **What did you study before the master?**
   
   Before the master, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze.

3. **Why did you choose this master?**

   I choose this master because I was looking for an interesting application of Mathematics. This master was the perfect match between my mathematic background and my passion for human body and medicine. 

4. **What do you consider to be the strong points of the master?**

   This master allows you to study Mathematics from an innovative perspective.
   Moreover, most of the courses are interactive and for some of the esams consists of a project. This means that you can develop your ideas, working in team with other students, getting in touch with the world of Scientific Research. 


5. **What did you like about the masters?**

   I loved most of the courses I chose. This master gives me the chance to open my mind on what Mathematics can be used to and how it can help Medicine to improve quality of life of patience. I also really appreciate the chance to collaborate with PhD students and Researchers during my internship abroad. This was very useful and formative, giving me the possibility to develop my thesis. 

   
6. **What did you do immediately after the master?**

   I graduated at the end of May. Then, after the summer, I start looking for a job and in September I started doing a stage in an international pharmaceutical company in Florence.

7.  **What are you doing right now in terms of work?**

   After the 6 months of stage, I got the job in the same company in the Finance Team.
    
8.  **Would you recommend the Masters to someone? To whom in particular?**

   I would recommend this master to all the students who are looking for an interesting application of Mathematics, in particular to all of them who are curious of using Mathematics to discover physical laws regulating human body. Mathematics in the biomedical field is countinously evolving and growing, for that reason I would recommend this master to all students who want to start having a first approach to the innovative and dynamic world of Modelling and Simulation for Biomedical Applications.
