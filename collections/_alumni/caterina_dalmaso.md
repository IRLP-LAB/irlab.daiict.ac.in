cv: "In October 2022 I graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in applied mathematics (curriculum Mathematics and Statistics for Life and Social Sciences, track Modelling and Simulation for Biomedical Applications) from the University of Trento. Currently, I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Trento, working on mathematical and computational models of the cardio-respiratory system."
research_interests: "I am deeply fascinated by the ways mathematics can be used to tackle medical problems and, possibly, aid the diagnostic and therapeutic processes. 
In particular, my main research interests lie in the patient-specific modelling of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems:
Implementation and analysis of patient-specific physics-based models for the quantification of the functional impact of coronary arterial stenoses on coronary blood flow in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Currently, I am working on UQ&SA for iFR predictions obtained through transient 1D-0D models.
Finite volume numerical schemes for the solution of hyperbolic PDEs, with a particular focus on 1D problems in vascular networks.
Integration of physiological aspects within available models of the cardiovascular systems: inclusion of respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and transport, and the involved control mechanisms within a 1D arterial-venous model."
