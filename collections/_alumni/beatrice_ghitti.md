cv: "In 2019, I obtained my Master’s Degree in Mathematics (curriculum Mathematics and Statistics for Life and Social Sciences, track Modelling and Simulation for Biomedical Applications) at the University of Trento, with a research thesis focused on fully well-balanced numerical schemes for the one-dimensional blood flow equations, under the joint supervision of Prof. Eleuterio F. Toro (University of Trento) and Prof. Christophe Berthon (University of Nantes, Nantes, France). Since November 2019, I have been a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Trento, under the supervision of Prof. Lucas O. Müller and Prof. Eleuterio F. Toro, working in the field of numerical analysis and mathematical modeling and simulation of human haemodynamics."
research_interests: "My main research interests include:
- reduced-order, multiscale (1D-0D) modeling of blood flow in the human cardiovascular system;
- development of numerical methods and strategies to perform computationally efficient and accurate blood flow simulations in complex vascular models and networks;
- extraction and calibration of subject-specific cerebral vascular networks from imaging data to be used for blood flow simulations, aiming at studying and exploring cerebral blood flow dynamics and its interaction with other intracranial fluids."
