cv: "In March 2023 I graduated with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Quantitative and Computational Biology (Biotechnological Track) at the University of Trento. Currently, I am working on a project whose objective is the creation of a quantitative model of root phenotypic plasticity in response to high salinity in Arabidopsis and rice."
research_interests: "My research interests are in the area of analysis of biological data. In particular, my focus is on the inference of a computationally derived gene regulatory networks using Arabidopsis and rice data to describe the mechanisms of growth of their roots under salt stress."
