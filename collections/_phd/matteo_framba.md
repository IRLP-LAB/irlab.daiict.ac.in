cv: "I graduated in Mathematics at the University of Bologna with a thesis on optimal transport and reinforcement learning. I took part in the 2019 ECMI event with the project *Epidemic models for Infectious Diseases*. I collaborated in 2020 with CERN on the CBI *Reducing diagnosis times for particular rare diseases* project. I am currently a PhD research fellow in Mathematics at the University of Trento, working on mathematical models and statistical inference in epidemiological studies."
research_interests: "My research activity studies quasi-reaction models using diffusion processes; the aim is to improve the estimation of parameters governing the dynamics of the process. Using both deterministic and stochastic approaches, I worked on mathematical models for gene therapies and epidemiological studies."
