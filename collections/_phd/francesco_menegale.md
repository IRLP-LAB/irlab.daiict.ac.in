cv: "I graduated with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Mathematics at University of Trento with a thesis on modelling West Nile virus transmission in Emilia-Romagna. Currently, I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Fondazione Bruno Kessler and University of Trento, working on mathematical models for infectious diseases."
research_interests: "My research activity focuses on the development of epidemiological models and computational
approaches informed by real-world data aimed at investigating the main features of the disease
spread among individuals. In particular, I work on mathematical models for childhood diseases, COVID-19, and vector-borne diseases."
