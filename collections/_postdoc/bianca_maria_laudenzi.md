cv: "In December 2022 I obtained a Master Degree in Mathematics with specific track “Modeling and Simulation for Biomedical Application” at the University of Trento. For my Master thesis project I did an internship at the Pennsylvania State University during which I worked on the analysis and the numerical treatment of a 1D co-axial model for computing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within cerebral perivascular spaces (PVS) coupled to the blood flow dynamics of vessels. Currently I am working at the University of Trento as a research assistant. I am collaborating on a project for the in-silico design of wearable- and computational model-driven digital twins for the monitoring of patients with cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory pathologies."
research_interests: "My main research interests include:
reduced order 1D and 0D models for the blood flow dynamics of the cardiovascular system;
model and study the interaction between vascular and PVS flow dynamics, defining appropriate strategies to perform efficient simulations in different network configurations of multiple vessel-PVS domains."
