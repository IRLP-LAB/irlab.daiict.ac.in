cv: "I have received the Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics at the University La Sapienza of Rome in 1978 and the Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1986. I have been first Researcher, then Associate professor, then (since 2005) Full Professor of Mathematical Analysis at the University of Trento. I spent periods of study at Cornell University, as Fulbright Fellow at Princeton University and as a visiting professor at Arizona State University."
research_interests: "My research activity has been almost entirely devoted to mathematical models in biology, and in particular on ecology and epidemiology. In my research I have dealt, on one hand, with the design and selection of detailed models adequate for the analysis of empirical data and, on the other hand, with the qualitative analysis of theoretical models aiming at understanding general patterns and trends. Among my recent research interests are
the dynamics of vector-borne infections, in particular those transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, considering their ecological interactions;
the analysis of immuno-epidemiological models, i.e. where between-host transmission dynamics is coupled to intra-host immunological interactions;
the use of methods from singular perturbation theory in the analysis of epidemic models."
