cv: "Dr. Simone Pezzuto is a senior researcher in Numerical Analysis at the Department of Mathematics of Università di Trento and an external collaborator at the Center for Computational Medicine in Cardiology (CCMC) and the Euler Institute of Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano. Dr. Pezzuto’s background is in applied mathematics and scientific computing, He received his Ph.D. in 2013 from Politecnico di Milano (MOX, Department of Mathematics). Until September 2022, he was Group Leader at the Center for Computational Medicine in Cardiology, an interdisciplinary institute of Università della Svizzera italiana (Lugano). Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Simula Research Laboratory, Norway."
research_interests: "Dr. Pezzuto’s main area of research is mathematical cardiac modeling. His group aims at the development of novel numerical methods for the personalization of cardiac models through PDE-constrained optimization and physics-based surrogate modeling. More recently, he investigated physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in the context of cardiac modeling. He is also very active and amongst the earliest investigators of UQ for cardiac electrophysiology models, with great emphasis on high-dimensional uncertainty and multi-fidelity approaches. In collaboration with clinicians and physiologists, these methodologies have been applied to problems of clinical interest, including atrial fibrillation and cardiac resynchronization therapy. Dr. Pezzuto has an extensive network of collaborations in Europe and worldwide. He is a team leader of the MICROCARD (https://microcard.eu/index-en.html) European project, a board member of the PersonalizeAF network (https://personalizeaf.net), and PI of several projects (3 currently active.) Additionally, Dr. Pezzuto is an active developer of the fast electrophysiology solver Propag-5 and the maintainer of the GPU-based eikonal solver Propeiko."
