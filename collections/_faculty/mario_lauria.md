cv: Mario Lauria earned a Laurea Magistrale in Electrical Engineering and a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the "Federico II" University of Naples, and a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He worked as a post-doc in computer science at the University of Illinois at U-C and at the University of California, San Diego, and from 2000 to 2007 as an Assistant Professor in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. After moving back to Italy he spent four years in the Systems Biology group at the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM) in Naples, and in May 2011 he joined the Microsoft Research-University of Trento Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI) in Rovereto, Italy. In December 2016 he joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Trento as associate professor of computational biology. Mario Lauria is a former Fulbright scholar, a recipient of a NATO Science Fellowship, and a Senior Member of the IEEE.
research_interests: "Marioâ€™s research interests are in the area of the analysis of biological data in a broad sense. The types of data of interest include molecular profiles (expression profiles, miRNA profiles, etc.), sensor data (for example, accelerometers, ECG, etc.), data collected using smartphones for clinical applications.  Some recent projects are:
development of novel methods for the identification of diagnostic biomarkers based on -omics profiles; 
investigation of systems biology approaches to perform integrative data analysis; 
development of methods for the inference of gene regulation networks and their analysis; 
investigation of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases using gene expression profiles
analysis of patient movement data collected using smartphone apps and activity trackers."
