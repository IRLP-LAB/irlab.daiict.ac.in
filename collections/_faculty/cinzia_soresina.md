cv: "I completed my education at the University of Parma and achieved the Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2017, awarded by the University of Milano. After the PhD, I have been postdoc at CNR-IMATI (2017) and at the University of Lisbon in Portugal (2018), INdAM visiting postdoc at Universit√© Paris 7 in France (2018), EuroTech-Marie Curie Fellow at TUM in Germany (2018-2020) and University Assistant at the University of Graz in Austria (2020-2023). Since 2024, I am Assistant Professor at the University of Trento in Mathematical Physics."
research_interests: "Most of my experience is in applied mathematics: my research interests focus on mathematical models in population dynamics, in particular predator-prey models, both homogeneous in space and with spatial diffusion. In the last ten years, I worked on several problems, using different techniques, tools and approaches: both PDEs and ODEs, from the theoretical and numerical point of view, PDEs with non-standard diffusion terms (cross-diffusion and fractional diffusion). bifurcation analysis and Turing instability, network analysis and synchronization, optimal control in epidemic models, stage-structured population models and their calibration using real field data."
