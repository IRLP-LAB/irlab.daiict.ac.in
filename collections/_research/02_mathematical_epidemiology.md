title: "Mathematical Epidemiology"
description: "For many years, there has been ongoing research on epidemic spread models in humans and other animals, in close collaboration with FBK, FEM, and numerous universities and research centers. Through mathematical models, we have analyzed seasonal influenza epidemics, as well as the 2009 influenza pandemic, studying the effects of control strategies ranging from social distancing interventions to the preventive use of antiviral drugs and vaccination. Another research topic has been vector-borne infections (particularly mosquitoes), analyzing the potential for the spread of tropical diseases such as dengue or chikungunya depending on the timing and location of a case’s entry into Italy, and studying the factors that contribute most to the increase in human cases of West Nile virus. The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus has demonstrated the potential of mathematical modeling to infer key epidemic parameters from partial and “noisy” data and to provide scenario analyses following possible interventions."

## 2.1 Pugliese

My research activity has been almost entirely devoted to mathematical models in biology, and in particular on ecology and epidemiology.
Among my recent research interests are
the dynamics of vector-borne infections, in particular those transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, considering their ecological interactions;
the analysis of immuno-epidemiological models, i.e. where between-host transmission dynamics is coupled to intra-host immunological interactions;
the use of methods from singular perturbation theory in the analysis of epidemic models.
