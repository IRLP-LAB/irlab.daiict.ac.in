title: "Biomedical Data Analysis"
description: "The research objectives of Biomedical Data Analysis focus on studying complex biological systems based on omics data, which increasingly characterize scientific research in the biomedical field. Omics data are molecular profiles of various types (RNA profiles, protein profiles, methylation profiles, genetic profiles), and their study has revolutionized biological research by allowing simultaneous reading of all elements of a class of molecules (RNA, proteins, etc.) present in a biological system at a certain moment. The Data Analysis group's research focuses on new methods of interpreting this data to address problems such as drug resistance in certain types of tumors (in collaboration with a group from the Human Technopole), the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases (collaboration with the University of Bologna, CIBIO, and Aptuit), the identification of molecular biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic use (collaboration with GSK Vaccines), and the metabolic alterations related to the interaction between diet and an individual's genotype (collaboration with Nestle Institute of Health Sciences). Many of these projects have also been carried out in collaboration with researchers from the COSBI Institute, which provides opportunities for numerous collaborations, especially in the pharmaceutical and academic fields."

### Description

We are interested in the development of statistical methodology and computational approaches related to graphical modelling of high dimensional multivariate data and modelling of network data. In the application area of biomedicine, we are particularly interested in the reconstruction of biological networks from high-throughput genomic data and in the modelling of the dynamic processes of cell differentiation and disease spreading. 

### Main research topics

Regularized inference for high-dimensional data
We study the penalised inferential framework in the context of graphical modelling, that is for the estimation of the inverse of the covariance matrix. We develop efficient computational methods for solving the estimating equations, in a variety of (non-standard) settings such as non-Gaussian and missing/censored data.

Reconstruction of biological networks
We apply graphical modelling approaches to the inference of biological networks from high-throughput genomic data. We develop bespoke models that adapt to the richness, heterogeneity and complexity of genomic data and implement efficient frequentist and Bayesian inferential schemes for statistical inference. In recent years, we have conducted extensive research on the reconstructing of transcriptomic networks and microbiota systems.

Statistical inference of quasi-reaction systems

We develop statistical methods for the inference of parameters of dynamic processes, such as cell differentiation and disease spreading, that can be characterized via quasi-reaction systems of stochastic differential equations. Recently, we are particularly interested in developing methods that combine local linear approximation procedures with event-history analyses. 

### Main collaborations

Institute of Computing, Università Svizzera italiana. We collaborate with Prof. Ernst Wit on the development of graphical modelling approaches and their application to genomics.
Scienze Economiche, Aziendali e Statistiche, Università degli Studi di Palermo. We collaborate with Prof. Luigi Augugliaro on computational statistical approaches for regularized inference.
