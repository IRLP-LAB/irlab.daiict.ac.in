abstract: "EYWA is a user-centric EarlY WArning System for MBDs, operational primarily in EU (intending to become global). 15 European organizations from Public Health, Mosquito Control, Private, and Research domains were joined under the EuroGEO Action Group for Epidemics to run the action. The team links to a network of 37 stakeholders and more than 70 experts from inside and outside EU following EYWA. Conceptually the action builds on the triptych Advocate-Engage-Deliver. It merges a co-design process with scientific/technical competencies. Needs, gaps and capacities are identified, while big data gathering, fusion and assimilation in mathematical and AI/ML modeling is effectively performed. EYWA leverages generic but advanced EU technologies (e.g. Copernicus, DIAS) for delivering a robust, scalable, and reliable service. The system was operationally deployed during the entire mosquito season (reaching TRL>7) in 4 Regions of Greece and 1 in Italy, providing regularly forecasts for Culex abundance and WNV infections. It guided the relevant in-field campaigns through targeted monitoring, preventive and door-to-door responsive actions, which in turn resulted in a meaningful decrease of mosquitoes and WNV and encephalitis cases. Sustained by a viable business plan, EYWA foresees a long-term operation, thus reaching out in the next 5 years additional sites from Serbia, Germany, and France, and support the control mechanisms for Culex, Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes. EYWA builds on the principle of open science, open innovation and open to the world. It shares data/products (with respect to GDPR and ethics regulations), and offers tools and best practices to be exploited further by scientists. Of outmost importance is the provision for enlarging the EYWA network by adding more countries and stakeholders through a well established on-boarding process. Between the ultimate goals is the delivery of a roadmap for setting a EU standard for MBDs control."
