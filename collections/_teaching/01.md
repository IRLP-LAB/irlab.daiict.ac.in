The Department of Mathematics promotes the Master of Science in Mathematics (Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Matematica), belonging to the class “LM-40 - Matematica”. The Master of Science in Mathematics is aimed at providing an in-depth knowledge and understanding of several areas of advanced Mathematics, and of its relations to other Sciences. Courses of the Master of Science in Mathematics are taught in English. The course is divided into curricula, which in turn are subdivided into tracks. 

There are two tracks that are heavily related to our laboratory:
- **Track: Modelling, Statistics and Analysis of Biosystems**
   
    This track provides a widespread preparation at the interface between Biological sciences, Mathematics and Informatics. Students from this track have continued with Ph.D. studies and beyond. An introduction to modern mathematical methods in areas of biology, ecology, epidemiology, molecular networks is provided. Companies, in particular from the pharmaceutical sector, are interested in students with these competences in modelling and Statistics.

- **Track: Modelling and Simulation for Biomedical Applications**
  
    Students from this track have the opportunity to develop strong abilities in numerical computation and to interact with clinical research in hospitals, universities and research centers. Such competences will provide students the possibility to continue their studies with a PhD in Applied Mathematics or in a biomedical program, as well as to work in the biomedical sector.

Mathematics for Data Science: Students from this track have the opportunity to learn the latest mathematical and statistical methodologies for the study of theoretical aspects of machine learning and data science. These are necessary for the modelling of real-world phenomena and for the analysis of high dimensional and complex data sets in various application areas, including biology and medicine. Such competences will provide students the possibility to continue their studies with a PhD in Statistics or Data Science.
