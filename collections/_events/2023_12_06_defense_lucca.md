description: "The development of efficient mathematical models and numerical methods for the study of haemodynamics is becoming
increasingly prominent in the analysis of pathological states of the cardiovascular system. Computational models contribute to
medical diagnosis processes, reducing the need of classical invasive medical techniques, which are not risk-free for patients
and generate high healthcare costs.
The first part of this thesis focuses on the modeling and simulation of coronary blood flow, with emphasis on stable Coronary
Artery Disease (CAD), a pathological condition that occurs when an abnormal narrowing builds inside coronary vessel walls.
Our goal is to develop a CCTA-based Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) model which incorporates clinical imaging and patient-
specific characteristics to predict the haemodynamic behavior and properties of individuals, reducing the need for invasive
measurements. A novel aspect of the proposed methodology is the inclusion of the pressure guidewire, used in clinical
settings, and the assessment of its impact on local fluid dynamics and FFR predictions.
Thereafter, the second part of this dissertation is devoted to the development of numerical methods for the simulation of
incompressible flows with particular emphasis on the simulation of cardiovascular haemodynamics. A novel implicit hybrid finite
volume/finite element methodology for the efficient simulation of blood flow is proposed and validated. The implicit
discretization of the transport-diffusion equations making use of an inexact Newton-Krylov method with an SGS preconditioner
yields to an efficient scheme avoiding the severe CFL condition arising in explicit or semi-implicit methods for blood flow
dynamics. Besides, the Ducros flux function employed for the nonlinear convective terms leads to a provably kinetic energy
stable scheme of the advection terms. In addition, a staggered semi-implicit method for the simulation of incompressible flows
in one-dimensional elastic and viscoelastic vessels is proposed. The convective stage is treated explicitly in time, while the
diffusive and pressure stage are handled implicitly to avoid strict bounds on the time steps. The one-dimensional methodology
is then extended to networks of vessels by introducing a local three-dimensional representation of the junction."
