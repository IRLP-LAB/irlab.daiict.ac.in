This work provides quantitative insights into the contribution of school transmission to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in young individuals. We analyzed data collected during 87 school outbreak investigations conducted between March and April 2021 in Reggio-Emilia, Italy. We applied a Bayesian approach to reconstruct the transmission chains between ascertained SARS-CoV-2 infections. We analyzed, among others, the percentage of infections among school attendees that were caused by school contacts; the secondary cases generated at school by positive individuals; and the potential effect of a timely diagnosis on the in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
