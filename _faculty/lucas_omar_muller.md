cv: In 2014 I received a PhD in computational modelling with application to cardiovascular problems by the University of Trento. After my PhD I worked as a postdoc at the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing in Petropolis (Brazil), and then at the Biomechanics group at the Norwegian University for Science and technology (NTNU) in Trondheim (Norway). After these experiences abroad, in 2019 I returned to Trento as an assistant professor. Currently I am an associate professor in numerical analysis.
research_interests: "My main research interests regard:
Using mathematical models to understand the physiology of the cardiovascular system and related solid/fluid systems (as for example brain tissue drainage, lymphatics, vessel-muscle interaction, etc).
Propose and study mathematical models arising in applications, as well as develop numerical methods to efficiently discretize such modes. Here I have mainly focused on hyperbolic conservation and balance laws in highly complex networks of one-dimensional domains. 
Collaborate with international and local clinical researchers to combine medical images and data with physics-based models in order to study pathological states of the cardiovascular system. This line of research involves the non-invasive prediction of hemodynamic indexes."
