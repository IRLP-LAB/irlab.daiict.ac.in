cv: I am full professor of Mathematical Analysis at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Trento since 1987. I have been Senior Fellow at the AHPCRC, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, U.S.A in 1990/91, and visiting researcher at the University of Paris-Nord and the University of Paris-Sud in 1979/80.
research_interests: "My research activity is in two main directions: one more related to numerical approximation of partial differential equations (especially in fluid dynamics and electromagnetism) by means of  finite element methods and domain decomposition methods; the other one more theoretical (existence and uniqueness theorems, qualitative properties of the solutions of partial differential equations)."
